## **The Problem**
In many Kenyan households, the standard LPG cylinder is a black box, leading to the frustration of unexpected gas runouts and the unspoken fear of undetected gas leaks. For energy providers, logistics are reactive and inefficient.

## **Our Solution**
CSG is a complete IoT ecosystem designed to make every cylinder smart. It consists of three parts:
*   **The CSG Smart Hub:** A non-invasive hardware device that attaches to any cylinder.
*   **The Consumer Mobile App:** An intuitive app for families to monitor gas levels and receive safety alerts.
*   **The Green Wells Corporate Dashboard:** A powerful web tool for managing logistics and assets with real-time data.

## **Live Demonstration & Prototype**

Our entire user journey has been prototyped in Figma and demonstrated in a video walkthrough.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Watch the Demo on YouTube
